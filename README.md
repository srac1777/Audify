## Intro
[Audify](https://audify-premium.herokuapp.com) is my attempt at cloning [Spotify Web Player](https://www.open.spotify.com) the music streaming service with over 140 million users and 40 million. While not so popular, Audify allows its users to stream songs, create playlists and follow playlists. It has a collection of a staggering 41 ~~million~~ songs.

## Technologies

I used React and Redux for the frontend and Ruby on Rails as the backend. PostgreSQL is the database I used which proved to be helpful (more on this later). Because Spotify is such a beautifully designed websit, I had the opportunity to work extensively with CSS to make my clone as similar as possible.


## Functionality

Audify allows its users to create playlists, add songs to playlists, search, and follow playlists.
I modelled the UX closely after the real app while adding a little more of my taste for drop shadows.
