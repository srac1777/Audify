## Intro
[Audify](https://audify-premium.herokuapp.com) was my attempt at cloning the Spotify Web Player. Spotify, as most of us know, is a music streaming service that has over 140 Million users worldwide with a library of 40+ Million songs. While Audify may not be of said popularity, I put forth the best of my efforts in creating its clone with a staggering 40+ ~~Million~~ songs in its library.

## Technologies

I built Audify using React-Redux for frontend interaction and Rails as the backend framework while using PostgreSQL as the database for development and production which proved to be helpful (oweing to it's pg_search). Owing to Spotify's modern design language, I had the opportunity to work extensively with CSS. I also used AWS S3 to store the songs and other assets.


## Functionality

Audify allows its users to create playlists, add songs to playlists, search, and follow playlists.
I modelled the UX closely after the real app while adding a little more of my taste for drop shadows.
